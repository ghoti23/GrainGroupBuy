    <!-- Call the JW Player JavaScript file, jwplayer.js.
    Replace DOWNLOAD-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME with the domain name of your
    CloudFront download distribution, for example, d1234.cloudfront.net
    (begins with "d"). This causes a browser to download the JW Player file
    before streaming begins.
